## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to the **Advanced Algorithms Handbook**. This repository is a specialized educational resource designed for computer engineers, CS students, and developers aiming to master high-complexity algorithmic theory and practice.

As an engineer and educator, my goal is to provide more than just functional code: this is a deep dive into **rigorous efficiency analysis** and **low-level architectural design**.

## 🚀 Repository Philosophy

This handbook stands on three fundamental pillars that differentiate it from standard algorithm collections:

1.  **Mathematical Rigor**: Detailed asymptotic analysis ($O, \Omega, \Theta$) and formal proofs of correctness.
2.  **Engineering Efficiency**: Implementations optimized for memory management, cache locality, and hardware constraints.
3.  **Pedagogical Clarity**: Structured documentation designed for seamless classroom integration and self-paced learning.
